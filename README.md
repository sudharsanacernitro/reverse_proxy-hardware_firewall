<h2><Introduction</h2>
This project uses an ESP8266 microcontroller to create a reverse proxy for a Python server. The ESP8266 not only forwards HTTP requests from clients to the server but also acts as a basic firewall, filtering incoming requests based on predefined rules. This setup adds an extra layer of security and allows for traffic management.
Hardware Requirements
ESP8266 microcontroller (e.g., NodeMCU)
USB cable for programming the ESP8266
A computer for running the Python server
Software Requirements
Arduino IDE for programming the ESP8266
Python 3.x installed on your server machine
Flask or any other Python web framework for creating the server
Connecting ESP8266 and Python Server
Ensure the ESP8266 is connected to the same network as the server.
Verify the IP address of your server and update the serverHost variable in the ESP8266 code.
Upload the updated code to the ESP8266.
Features
Reverse Proxy: Forwards HTTP requests from clients to the Python server.
Firewall: Basic filtering of incoming requests.
Modular: Easy to modify and extend for additional functionalities.
Security Considerations
Authentication: Implement authentication mechanisms to secure the communication between clients and the server.
Rate Limiting: Add rate limiting to prevent abuse and denial-of-service attacks.
Logging: Maintain logs to monitor and analyze traffic.
Troubleshooting
Connection Issues: Ensure that the ESP8266 is connected to the WiFi network and can reach the server.
Firewall Rules: Verify that your firewall rules are correctly configured and not blocking legitimate traffic.
Logs: Check the logs on both the ESP8266 (via Serial Monitor) and the Python server for any error messages.
