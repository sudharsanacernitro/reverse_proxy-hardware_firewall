<h1>Reverse Proxy and Firewall with ESP8266 for Python Server</h1>
<h2>Overview</h2>
This project demonstrates how to create a reverse proxy using an ESP8266 microcontroller for a Python server. The ESP8266 acts as an intermediary, forwarding requests from clients to the server and providing an additional layer of security by acting as a firewall.<br>

<h2>Introduction</h2>
This project uses an ESP8266 microcontroller to create a reverse proxy for a Python server. The ESP8266 not only forwards HTTP requests from clients to the server but also acts as a basic firewall, filtering incoming requests based on predefined rules. This setup adds an extra layer of security and allows for traffic management.<br>
<h3>Hardware Requirements</h3><br>
ESP8266 microcontroller (e.g., NodeMCU)<br>
USB cable for programming the ESP8266<br>
A computer for running the Python server<br>
<h3>Software Requirements</h3><br>
Arduino IDE for programming the ESP8266<br>
Python 3.x installed on your server machine<br>
Flask or any other Python web framework for creating the server<br>
Connecting ESP8266 and Python Server<br>
Ensure the ESP8266 is connected to the same network as the server.<br>
Verify the IP address of your server and update the serverHost variable in the ESP8266 code.<br>
Upload the updated code to the ESP8266.<br>
<h2>Features</h2>
Reverse Proxy: Forwards HTTP requests from clients to the Python server.<br>
Firewall: Basic filtering of incoming requests.<br>
Modular: Easy to modify and extend for additional functionalities.<br>
<h2>Security Considerations</h2>
Authentication: Implement authentication mechanisms to secure the communication between clients and the server.<br>
Rate Limiting: Add rate limiting to prevent abuse and denial-of-service attacks.<br>
Logging: Maintain logs to monitor and analyze traffic.<br>
